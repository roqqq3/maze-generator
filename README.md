# maze-generator
A maze generator written in Rust. Supports theoretically unlimited sizes, although the generation will take very long with large dimensions. Supports saving generated maze to a file. Based on Jacek Wieczorek's C code on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm).

Usage:
1. run with `cargo run`
2. select dimensions
3. optionally select filepath
